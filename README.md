# Product Similarity based on Bill of Materials (Cosine Similarity)

This project demonstrates how to compute **product-to-product similarity** using **cosine similarity** on a **simulated Bill of Materials (BOM)** and a few numeric features (e.g., price, weight).  
It is intended for portfolio purposes: the dataset is **fully simulated** and does **not** represent any real company data.

## Why this matters
Cosine similarity is useful to compare products by component composition and features, enabling tasks like:
- finding similar items for substitution or assortment planning
- grouping products into families
- building simple recommendation heuristics

## Project structure
```
bom_cosine_similarity/
├─ data/
│  └─ sample_bom.csv          # simulated BOM-like features
├─ cosine_similarity.ipynb    # notebook version
├─ cosine_similarity.py       # script version
├─ requirements.txt
└─ README.md
```

## How to run
```bash
# 1) Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate

# 2) Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 3) Run the script or use the notebook
python cosine_similarity.py
# or open cosine_similarity.ipynb in Jupyter/VS Code
```

## Outputs
- `cosine_similarity_matrix.csv` – full similarity matrix
- `cosine_similarity_heatmap.png` – heatmap visualization
- printed top-N similar items via a simple `recommend()` helper

## Notes
- The dataset is intentionally simple to highlight the method.
- You can extend it with additional numeric/categorical features or weighting schemes.
- If you previously used a similar approach in industry, you can mention that this repo **recreates the idea with simulated data** for confidentiality.
